# Write a program on Calculation of area for a Right Angled Triangle.
# Input the measureent of base.
x = int(input("Enter the Value of Base: "))
# Input the value measurment of height.
y = int(input('Enter the Value of Height: '))
# Developing the equation for area calclulation.
Area= .5*x*y
# Final output after providing all the values.
print('Area of the Right Angled Triangle = ', str(Area) , 'square centimeters')
# The unit of calculation can be changed according to the specfications of calculation.
Resutls after running the python code:
Enter the Value of Base: 16
Enter the Value of Height: 12
Area of the Right Angled Triangle =  96.0 square centimeters
